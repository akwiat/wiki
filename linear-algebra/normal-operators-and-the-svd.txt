===== Normal Operators =====
An operator is normal iff it commutes with its adjoint: $\left[A, B\right] = 0$. Equivalently, an operator is normal iff it admits an orthonormal eigenbasis, and we'll see here why that's true and where the SVD fits in.

==== SVD Refresher ====
For the full details see the wikipedia article on the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular-value_decomposition|svd]]: According to the SVD, any operator $A$ can be written in the form:
$$A = UDV^{\dagger}$$
Where $U$ and $V$ are unitary and $D$ is diagonal with positive-definite entries (positive-semidefinite if $A$ is singular).

The intuitive interpretation is that you can break down the action of $A$ into the following steps:
  - Rewrite the input in terms of the orthonormal basis given by the columns of $V$
  - Apply the scaling transform $D$
  - Rotate each unit vector into the corresponding column of $U$

Keep in mind that this is only the same as an eigen-decomposition if the two unitaries are equal: $U = V$
