====== Normal Operators ======
An operator $A$ is normal iff it commutes with its adjoint: $\left[A, A^{\dagger}\right] = 0$. Equivalently, an operator is normal iff it admits an orthonormal eigenbasis, and we'll see here why that's true and where the SVD fits in.

==== Properties of Normal Operators ====
If $\left[A, A^{\dagger}\right] = 0$, then $A$ and $A^{\dagger}$ preserve each other's eigenspaces, which means that if $|\nu\gt$ is an eigenvector of $A$, then it's also an eigenvector of $A^{\dagger}$.

Also, since:
$$\lambda_\nu \lt\nu|A\nu\gt = $\ltA^{\dagger}\nu|\nu\gt = \bar{\lambda^{\dagger}_{\nu}}$$
you know that $\lambda_\nu$-eigenvectors of $A$ are $\bar{\lambda_\nu}$-eigenvectors of $A^{\dagger}$



===== SVD Refresher =====
For the full story see the wikipedia article on the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular-value_decomposition|SVD]], but here are a couple highlights.

According to the SVD, any operator $A$ can be written in the form:
$$A = UDV^{\dagger}$$
Where $U$ and $V$ are unitary and $D$ is diagonal with positive-definite entries (positive-semidefinite if $A$ is singular).

The intuitive interpretation is that you can break down the action of $A$ into the following steps:
  - Rewrite the input in terms of the orthonormal basis given by the columns of $V$
  - Apply the scaling transform $D$ (which acts in the new unit directions)
  - Rotate each unit vector into the coordinate vector in the corresponding column of $U$

Keep in mind that this is only the same as an eigen-decomposition if the two unitaries in question are equal: $U = V$


===== SVD of a normal operator =====
If the SVD of $A$ is $UDV^{\dagger}$, then you can take the adjoint of both sides to get:
$$ A^\dagger = VDU^\dagger $$
Then, apply the condition of normality $\left[A, A^{\dagger}\right] = 0$ and plug in to get:
$$ UDV^\dagger VDU^\dagger = VDU^\dagger UDV^\dagger $$
Which reduces to
$$ UD^2U^\dagger = VD^2V\dagger $$
