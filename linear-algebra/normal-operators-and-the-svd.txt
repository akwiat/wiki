====== Normal Operators ======
An operator $A$ is normal iff it commutes with its adjoint: $\left[A, A^{\dagger}\right] = 0$. Equivalently, an operator is normal iff it admits an orthonormal eigenbasis, and we'll see here why that's true and where the SVD fits in.

==== Properties of Normal Operators ====
If $\left[A, A^{\dagger}\right] = 0$, then $A$ and $A^{\dagger}$ preserve each other's eigenspaces, which means that if $|\nu\gt$ is an eigenvector of $A$, then it's also an eigenvector of $A^{\dagger}$.

Also, since:
$$\lambda_\nu = \lt\nu|A\nu\gt = \lt A^{\dagger}\nu|\nu\gt = \bar{\lambda^{\dagger}_{\nu}}$$
you know that $\lambda_\nu$-eigenvectors of $A$ are $\overline{\lambda_\nu}$-eigenvectors of $A^{\dagger}$

To show that the eigenvectors of $A$ are mutually orthogonal, consider the matrix elements of $A$ with respect to a pair of eigenvectors ($|\mu\gt$, $|\nu\gt$):
$$\lt\mu|A|\nu\gt = \lt\mu|A\nu\gt = \lt A^{\dagger}\mu|\nu\gt$$
by properties of the adjoint. Assuming that $|\mu\gt$ and $|\nu\gt$ are eigenvectors with distinct eigenvalues $\mu$ and $\nu$, you can modify the above to read:
$$\mu\lt\mu|\nu\gt = \nu\lt\mu|\nu\gt$$
which forces you to conclude that $\lt\mu|\nu\gt = 0$.

Since all the eigenvectors of $A$ are mutually orthogonal, you can rewrite $A$ in terms of its eigen-decomposition:
$$A = UDU^{\dagger}$$
with unitary $U$ and diagonal $D$ (assuming you normalized the eigenvectors).

Once you've written $A$ in this form, it's a lot clearer why the eigenvalues of $A$ and $A^{\dagger}$ are related by complex conjugation ($A^{\dagger} = UD^{\dagger}U^{\dagger}).

You can also double check explicitly that $A$ and $A^{\dagger}$ commute (but you know they must since $UDU^{\dagger}$ and $UD^{\dagger}U^{\dagger}$ necessarily have the same eigenspaces.)

===== Hermitian and Anti-Hermitian Operators =====
Hermitian ($A^{\dagger} = A$) and Anti-Hermitian ($A^{\dagger} = -A$) are special cases of normal operators. One way to think about a general linear operator (normal or otherwise) is in terms of its Hermitian and Anti-Hermitian components (analogous to symmetric and anti-symmetric components). That is, you can write a general operator $M$ as:

$$M = \frac{1}{2}(M + M^{\dagger}) + \frac{1}{2}(M - M^{\dagger}) = H + K$$
where $H$ is defined to be the first term (which is Hermitian) and $K$ is defined to be the second term (which is Anti-Hermitian).

Another equivalent way of thinking about normal operators is to convince yourself that $M$ is normal iff $H$ and $K$ commute. If they commute they must have a simultaneous orthonormal eigenbasis, which is then necessarily an orthonormal eigenbasis of $M$. (You can also directly compute $[M, M^{\dagger}]$ to verify).

This interpretation may be useful in the case that a $M$ is a linear operator such that the Hermitian and Anti-Hermitian components have a small non-zero commutator. In this case, you could say (in a vague way) that $M$ is *almost* unitarily diagonalizeable.

===== SVD Refresher =====
For the full story see the wikipedia article on the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular-value_decomposition|SVD]], but here are a couple highlights.

According to the SVD, any operator $A$ can be written in the form:
$$A = UDV^{\dagger}$$
Where $U$ and $V$ are unitary and $D$ is diagonal with positive-definite entries (positive-semidefinite if $A$ is singular).

The intuitive interpretation is that you can break down the action of $A$ into the following steps:
  - Rewrite the input in terms of the orthonormal basis given by the columns of $V$
  - Apply the scaling transform $D$ (which acts in the new unit directions)
  - Rotate each unit vector into the coordinate vector in the corresponding column of $U$

Keep in mind that this is only the same as an eigen-decomposition if the two unitaries in question are equal: $U = V$


===== SVD of a normal operator =====
If the SVD of $A$ is $UDV^{\dagger}$, then you can take the adjoint of both sides to get:
$$ A^\dagger = VDU^\dagger $$
Then, apply the condition of normality $\left[A, A^{\dagger}\right] = 0$ and plug in to get:
$$ UDV^\dagger VDU^\dagger = VDU^\dagger UDV^\dagger $$
Which reduces to
$$ UD^2U^\dagger = VD^2V\dagger $$
