====== The definitive guide to how each faction lost the Syrian Civil War ======
The war in Syria turned seven years old in mid-March. Arguably, things are winding down, but for a war that some say is nearing conclusion there are still a LOT of groups that hate each other involved.

You shouldn't worry about this war, because it sucks, and should probably hit the back button on your browser right now. If you want to continue, here's a way-too-detailed rundown of everyone whose followed this thing into its seventh year. Afterwards, go do something happy, because the next 3000 words aren't going to give you many good thoughts. It's a mountain of shit, and there's basically no silver lining at the end.

Still reading? Here goes.

==== SAA - Syrian Arab Army ====
| **Who are they**: | The official armed forces of Bashar al Assad |
| **Who are they, really**: | A few true military units, many more largely-conscripted Syrian ethnic militas, some Iranian militias, Hezbollah and Russian Military Contractors |
| **Who they fight**: | All rebels except TFSA; ISIS; occasionally the SDF; occasionally Israel |
| **Who they are allied with**: | Russia |
| **Despicability rating (1 = Ghastly, 10 = Utopian (Sweden?))**: | 3.5/10  |

The Syrian Arab Army is a scam. It "sounds" like a real army, is equipped like a real army, has a structure like a real army and is treated like a real army. In reality, it's basically a kitchen sink of every dude Assad and his backers could put together, including legitimate terrorists, militias organized by ethnic groups, a bunch of Afghan dudes on the payroll for Iran and Chechen/Russian dudes on the payroll of Russia (and, admittedly, a //couple// semi-regular army units).

After huge portions of his army were defecting, our buddy Bashar decided to run to Iran and one of the world's shadiest military commanders, Qassem Sulemani, for help. In a room where it's reported that the overall karma was so low that the integer used to represent it wrapped around, Sulemani told Assad that having a normal army was stupid, and the only way he would win would be to reorganize his armed forces into two groups: special forces, and militas organized around ethnicity so that they would be fighting for their "people". This resulted in the creation of the Tiger Forces, a fairly dominant special forces group that has probably earned the title of the war's single most effective armed group, and the NDF, a fairly incompetent but massively-sized militia that forms the bulk of Assad's armed forces.

Assad didn't stop there, and asked two of his three international leader friends (everyone except Kim Jong Un, who is actually, and this is not a joke, a legitimate supporter of Assad that tried to give him a nuclear power plant and has now been accused of supplying chemical weapons), to send dudes to fight for him. Iran and Sulemani sent a handful of people from the Iran Revolutionary Guard to start, then convinced Hezbollah to join in and hired a bunch of pretty unmotivated Afghans to hold down the fort in certain areas (they aren't very motivated and were some of the guys who lost Palmyra to ISIS). Russia, who is fairly casualty conscious, sent its air force and a bunch of tanks, and later sent a bunch of private military contractors whose only particular action of note was getting annihilated by almost every type of plane the US owns when they tried to attack some oil fields controlled by the SDF. (ONLY funny moment of this entire war: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLPvdmDN8Mg|even America sent a few guys]]).

As much as anyone can claim to be, the SAA are winning, and despite the fact Assad is literally allied with Hezbollah, this is somehow no worse than most other realistic options. Assad is at least somewhat secular and has an acceptable record of protecting minorities. He also has a ridiculous amount of blood on his hands, and has indisputably and repeatedly used chemical weapons against his people. Also, even in victory, Assad is losing a lot -- it's unlikely that his family's hereditary rule of Syria will extend beyond his death, and he probably won't be able to exert any meaningful degree of control over the northern half of his country again at any point in his lifetime. Assad will come out of this thing as good as anyone, but noone, least of all he, should be happy about it.

==== Syrian Democratic Forces ====
| **Who are they**: | A multi-ethnic military group that support democratic confederalism across Syria |
| **Who are they, really**: | Mostly a Kurdish militia with strong ties to the PKK, a Turkish-based terrorist group, though there are significant Arab components as well, backed by American Special Forces |
| **Who they are allied with**: | The Coalition (specifically US) |
| **Who they fight**: | ISIS; Turkey; TFSA; sometimes other rebels; occasionally the government |
| **Despicability rating**: | 6/10 |

The SDF are the good guys in this war, which isn't saying much. Their backbone is the YPG militia, which is more or less synonymous with the PKK, an organization classified by the US and Turkey as a terrorist group (admittedly a bit harshly -- in some ways they're more freedom fighters than terrorists). And, while they stand for democracy, they haven't been all that consistent in carrying it out. They've arrested a number of opposition parities to their rule and occasionally turned violent against demonstrators.

Still, the SDF are probably the only faction that's even possible to root for with a clean conscious. They adhere to a philosophy called democratic confederalism, a sort of a hybrid between democracy and communism espoused by an obscure American philosopher named Murray Bookchin (which isn't inherently good or bad, but it's tremendously fascinating that they picked up on some random ideas published in a few academic papers and tried to build a nation out of it). In addition, the Kurdish groups that form their backbone have been oppressed in Syria for years and years, so as long as they don't go about seeking vengeance it is nice to see them get a taste of self-rule. Also, did I mention they are super feminist and have many women fighters, all the way up to senior military commanders? Awesome! And we're fucking stuck with John Kelly.

That all made it pretty disappointing when the SDF were drawn into direct conflict with Turkey this year. In one of the clearest signs of how fucked up this war is, two allied nations, America and Turkey, are now fighting each other through proxies. Turkey has threatened larger moves against the SDF, including an attack on the city of Manbij, which the SDF heroically captured from ISIS in 2016 during one of the only feel-good moments of the war. Doing so might see shooting between American Special Forces and Turkish proxies or even the Turkish army. That wouldn't be good for anyone.

The SDF are equipped and trained by the US, though the US has never given them heavy weapons (i.e tanks) or anti-aircraft weapons (called MANPADS). That leaves them relatively vulnerable to an all-out assault by either Turkey or the SAA. The US would presumably back them in a fight against the SAA, though attacks by Turkey would -- and did -- create a true mess of a situation. It's likely that the US will try to bolster the Arab components of the SDF and install them in the more sensitive areas in an attempt to placate Turkey. Whether it works will remain to be seen.

==== Rebels ====
Rebels is the mother of catch all terms. It's such a catch all term that it contains other catch all terms (e.g. FSA). No meaningful analysis can be done at this level, so we got to add a thousand words to go through these guys one-by-one.

Sorry.

=== Free Syrian Army (FSA) ===
| **Who are they**: | The official resistance to Bashar al Assad consisting of ex-SAA and concerned citizenry |
| **Who are they, really**: | A nearly extinct species |
| **Who they fight**: | The government; ISIS; HTS at times |
| **Who they are allied with**: | Depends a lot locally. Sometimes other rebels, others times the SDF, others Turkey. Some small groups are even allied with the government. |
| **Despicability rating**: | 5/10 |

The FSA still does exist, technically speaking. Mostly, they've been undone by a heartbreakingly brilliant strategy by Assad and Russia. Assad realized that if America/Western Europe got involved he was a goner, so early in the war he brutally attacked any group he thought we might be able to get behind, killing untold numbers of civilians in the process through an effectual scorched earth campaign. It's no coincidence that ISIS controlled almost half the country at one point while moderates struggled to fully control a single city: Assad planned it that way, effectively ignoring ISIS until he had already doomed the moderates to failure.

The FSA was never a single group, and while most of its components have been defeated (or forced to join with hardliners for protection), a few do remain. Most are kind of over fighting at this point and are just holding down the fort until they eventually meet the government at the negotiating table. The Deraa province, in South Syria, is the main bastion controlled largely by the FSA (though hardliners have a presence as well), and they also control the town and surroundings of Dumayr in rural Damascus and the Rastan pocket in central Syria (again, in conjunction with hardliners). Idlib, the overall main rebel stronghold, once contained a litany of moderate groups, but the emergence of HTS (see below) as the central power in the province and the serious $$ offered by Turkey to join its own war in Syria pretty much eliminated these, with Jaysh al-Izza being the only one of any note that remains.

It's a shame, really, that there was never a good option on the table to support the FSA. They saw significant success early in the war, and they offered really the only path to "victory" that this war ever saw. It's possible, though, that even if they had captured Damascus, they would have had their own struggle against hardline elements (which they never tried hard enough to distance themselves from) and ISIS (see: Libya), which may have been nearly impossible to win. I guess we'll be left wondering.

=== Turkish Free Syrian Army (TFSA) ===
| **Who are they**: | Rebels who decided to head northward |
| **Who are they**, really: | An anti-Kurd force composed of Turkey and Turkish Proxies |
| **Who they fight**: | ISIS orignally; now SDF and occasionally the government |
| **Who they are allied with**: | Turkish Armed Forces; Ahrar al Sham & co |
| **Despicability rating**: | Difficult to rate definitively but I'll say 4.5 |

This bunch of dudes really has nothing in common other than who signs their paychecks: Turkey. They follow Turkish priorities, are equipped by the Turkish government and often fight directly alongside the Turkish army.

Turkey decided to sit out the Syrian Civil War until late 2016, when they "suddenly realized" that smuggling by ISIS was happening through their southern border and causing instability within Turkey. In reality, their mission was a reaction to the success of the Kurds, who were threatening to consolidate control over the entire Syria-Turkey border (other than Idlib, that is).

This initial operation only concerned ISIS, but Turkey recently decided to engage the SDF directly by attacking Afrin, a mountain fortress and extremely pro-Kurd area. Afrin was the one Kurdish area without American Special Forces embedded in it, which made it a less politically complex target. Though the operation started embarrassingly slowly, it was ultimately quite successful, and only a bit of mop-up remains for them in this pocket.

Turkey's ambitions with the increasingly large number of territories it controls in Syria are unclear. They may become an "unrecognized" part of Turkey (similar to the Golan Heights with Israel), they may give them to the government in return for some favour, they may use them to resettle the Syrian refugees who are currently living in camps in Turkey.  It's also unclear if they'll pursue further action against the Kurds, which could potentially bring them in conflict with US Special Forces (not good for anyone). Erdogan's hand is politically quite complicated (he's nominally allied to the US but hates its proxy, the SDF, and courting a friendship with Russia but doesn't care for it's proxy, the government, either), but what he decides will shape the immediate future of this stupid war.

=== Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) ===
| **Who are they**: | A Salafi Islamist Jihadist group. The most powerful rebel group in the rebel stronghold of Idlib, probably most powerful overall |
| **Who are they**, really: | Al Qaeda, allegedly backed by Qatar |
| **Who they fight**: | everyone, although not always other Rebels |
| **Who they are allied with**: | One tiny group of terrible people called Jund al Aqsa |
| **Despicability rating**: | 2/10, maybe lower |

A long time ago there was a an Al Qaeda affiliate in Syria called Jabhat al Nusra. Arguably the most influential rebel group early in the 2013-14 years, they kind of got their thunder stolen by the emergence of ISIS, who became the more powerful and well-known anti-Western radical Islamist group (sadly, this is a valid taxonomy).

Undeterred, HTS decided to refocus in the Idlib province, which they hoped to turn into an Al Qaeda "emirate". They formed an alliance with Ahrar al Sham which they called as Jaish al Fateh (Army of Conquest -- honestly a pretty dope name for a rebel group) and succeeded in kicking the Syrian Army out of Idlib.

As major countries started to notice the alarming amount of territory Al Qaeda was accumulating in northern Syria, HTS "broke" with Al Qaeda in July, 2016 and became Jabat Fateh al Sham. The split was in name only. Al Qaeda's leader sort of ruined the surprise by releasing a memo a couple months before it happened where he said that groups to which the Al Qaeda name did more harm than good were welcome to "break" from Al Qaeda formally in order to better carry out its mission.

Apparently disappointed that so many remained unconvinced, the group changed its name again to Hay'at Tahrir al Sham. It continues to insist it has split from Al Qaeda (and in its defense, there's very little to suggest it's directly involved with international terrorism, at least yet), but stay woke. These aren't good guys.

HTS controls Idlib city and most of the core of the Idlib province, which it has made an extremely not fun place to live, with dumb ISIS-esque laws.

=== Ahrar al Sham/Syrian Liberation Front/Nour al-Din al-Zenki ===
| **Who are they**: | A cluster of less radical, nominally-allied, still primarily Salafi Islamist Jihadist groups. The second most powerful group in the rebel stronghold of Idlib |
| **Who are they, really**: | Honestly, maybe the only group that is who they say they are. Not that that's good or anything. Backed by Turkey (definitely) and Saudi Arabia (formerly and probably still somewhat) |
| **Who they fight**: | HTS; the government; occasionally the SDF |
| **Who they are allied with**: | Presumably TFSA |
| **Despicability rating**: | 3.5/10 |

Despite it's power, basically everyone in Idlib hates HTS now. These groups have fought alongside HTS against the government in the past, and continue to do so at times, but also fight against HTS on an increasingly frequent basis in what amounts to a civil war inside a civil war (I did warn you how stupid this stuff is). None are really good guys, though, although it's difficult to tell exactly how bad they are because they really jump around the spectrum. In general, they're considered less of a "threat" than HTS since they're extremely accountable to their international backers, specifically Turkey.

Ahrar al Sham is the second largest rebel group in Idlib and is also somewhat active in the south of Syria. They had their own rumoured Al Qaeda links, but it's not really fair to call them Al Qaeda or a terrorist group. In reality, they're kind of a Saudi proxy that's become a Turkish proxy since it emerged Saudi Arabia had no fucking clue what it even wanted to happen in Syria. Ahrar spent many a day in battle alongside HTS but is now its main rival, and it controls most of southern Idlib up to Maarrat al Nu'man, the province's second largest city.

Nour al-Din al-Zenki is, like, the group that can't decide whose (rebel) side it's in. Originally it was a fucking FSA (!!) group that was armed by the CIA and part of Fateh Halab, the mostly moderate group that controlled rebel-held Aleppo. During the fall of Aleppo, a gruesome video emerged of al Zenki beheading a young child it had captured, and not long after it completed its move to the dark(er) side by announcing it was joining HTS (read: Al Qaeda). This makes it the only FSA group to literally become terrorists.

After like 3 months, though, al-Zenki was like "nope I'm out" and fought against HTS before joining with Ahrar al Sham. Figuring out what these guys believe in is arguably the most complicated task of this stupidly complicated conflict.

The common assumption is that, at some point, Turkey is going to come riding over the hill and help these groups win their on and off civil war with HTS. Either that, or the government will retake Idlib in some sort of atrocious battle, killing everyone in the process. Either way will probably not be good news for civilians, which unlike in many areas there are still a lot of in Idlib.

=== New Syrian Army ===
| **Who are they**: | Explicitly American-backed rebels in the Syrian desert |
| **Who are they**, really: | A joke |
| **Who they fight**: | Sporadic battles against ISIS and the government |
| **Who they are allied with**: | USA; Jordan |
| **Despicability rating**: | Irrelevant |

Worth mentioning I guess because, by sheer land area, they're quickly becoming the largest rebel group. Originally, this group was set up by US to control the Syria/Iraq border, effectively as a favour for Israel. Hezbollah's payoff for fighting in Syria is presumed to be weapons from Iran, and the US hoped to build a group strong enough to prevent the SAA from recapturing the Iraq border, which would break up the smuggling route for these weapons (Iran -> Iraq -> Syria -> Lebanon). The New Syrian Army did capture one of the two major border posts between Iran and Syria and attacked the other, but during the middle of their assault on the second (at al Bukumal, a major ISIS stronghold at the time) the US bizarrely pulled its air cover and they had to make a hasty retreat.

The SAA has now captured al Bukumal, completely dooming the mission these guys were created for, and their land really just contains a couple villages and one very large refugee camp on the Jordanian border. Also, this group is like, at most, 1,000 guys, and the SAA would have run over them if McMaster hadn't decided to reinstate US air protection when SAA-aligned militias attacked last year. These guys are probably gonna keep sitting around doing nothing in the desert for some time to come.

==== ISIS ====
| **Who are they**: | A spy agency featured in the show Archer |
| **Who are they, really**: | Google it |
| **Who they fight**: | The world |
| **Who they were allied with**: | Remember that tiny group of terrible people called Jund al Aqsa that now fights with HTS? Yeah. Those guys get along. |
| **Despicability rating**: | 100% Certified Terrorists |

Wait, you thought ISIS was defeated? You thought wrong. Thankfully, ISIS is just a shadow of its former self, but it still controls five pockets in Syria. Worryingly, almost all are stable.

Most remaining ISIS territory is near the Syria/Iraq border, where it was assumed the government and SDF would make short work of it. However, both factions have other priorities right now -- the SDF fighting Turkey and the government fighting the rebels -- and are pretty much ignoring these ISIS lands. Two of them, thank heavens, are pretty much depopulated desert, but the third, around the town of Hajin, potentially has up to 100,000 people living in it still (though 10K-20K is probably a more accurate estimate given the number of people who have fled).

ISIS also controls most of the Yarmouk Camp, in Damascus, and a small pocket around the town of Tasil near the Israel and Jordan borders. The SAA has seemed unconcerned with Yarmouk Camp, and the rebels which surround the Tasil pocket are probably too weak to take it out, so these areas are likely to endure for some time.

If that weren't enough bad news, consider this. ISIS rose largely through the Sunni tribal politics of rural Syria and Iraq. While a number of the members of these tribes were killed, most of the tribes are still extant. And, the dissatisfaction that initially caused them to form ISIS remains, and has probably been amplified. In other words, ISIS has been militarily defeated, but most of the conditions that led to the creation of ISIS remain.

So that's not good.
